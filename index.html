<p>Thank you to all involved in the development of Csound which is used as the playback engine for tunes. Thanks also to the developers of ABCJs(http://abcjs.net/) which provides the sheet music view of the tunes. Finally, I'd like to reserve a special thanks to the real Seamus, whom this app is dedicated to.
