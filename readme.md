Seamus Tunes is a simple app that searches internet sites such as www.thesession.org and www.abcnotation.com for traditional Irish tunes. It displays music in either standard notation or ABC format and also features a playback mechanism for listening back to the tunes. Tunes can also be saved for offline use.  

Seamus uses ABCJs(http://abcjs.net/) to render the music as standard notation and Csound(http://csound.github.io/) for the playback engine. Note that some tunes may not play back correctly due to poor formatting in the original ABC notation.
